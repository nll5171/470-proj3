          <p>This is a simple project designed around decorating a Christmas tree with ornaments! Due to time
            constraints,
            I had to cut things down to one ornament, and even then I didn't finish on time due to SocketIO
            problems :(</p>
          <p>That said, I hope you find some form of enjoyment out of this project. Check below for the instructions on
            how this works!</p>

        <div class="container">
          <h2 class="py-3 mb-4 border-bottom text-center">Instructions</h2>
          <p>Use the joystick to move around the ornament! The further you push the joystick, the faster you'll move!
          </p>
          <p>When you're happy with its placement, press on the joystick until you hear a click. This will place the
            ornament down.</p>
          <p>If you want to move around another ornament, simply use the joystick again!</p>

  <!-- Here, at the bottom of the body, we import our socket.io library
  for the client to use. We do this at the bottom to ensure that the page
  has otherwise been setup for us. 
  
  When we created our socket.io server in /server/io.js, it added routes
  for /socket.io/socket.io.js (as well as a minified version) so that our
  server hosts the client code as well. -->
  <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

  <!-- We then load our own client code, which express hosts for us. Remember
  that the /assets url tree is the /hosted folder. -->
